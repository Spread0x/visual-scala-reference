# `unfold`

{{< signature unfold >}}

`unfold` creates a collection by taking each pair of values returned by the function `f` both to get the current element and calculate the next, as long as the function returns them wrapped with `Some`.

It stops building the collection as soon as `f` returns `None`.

The first time the function `f` is applied it's fed with the initial value `s`.
