# `reduceRight`

{{< signature reduceRight >}}

`reduceRight` applies the binary operator `op` to each element, going from right to left, and the previous `op` result.
The first time `op` is applied it's fed with the last two elements.

On single-element collections that only element is returned and the binary operator `op` is not applied.
