# `reduceLeft`

{{< signature reduceLeft >}}

`reduceLeft` applies the binary operator `op` to each element, going from left to right, and the previous `op` result.
The first time `op` is applied it's fed with the two first elements.

On single-element collections that only element is returned and the binary operator `op` is not applied.
